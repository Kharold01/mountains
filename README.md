CMP237 Extended example from Ch. 6

I decided to do centered text cells and basically using the "date passed" to find out the age of my person and add it to the table. 

CTextCell is where the code is for the centering of cells.

printDataRJ is where it prints the underlined cells centered as well as cells that have numbers in them. This file also contains the fix to the pattern of the dates. 

randomInfo contains my data set and it also has the code for calculating the age based on time passing. Side note: my heights are clearly not correct for a few of the people but that was for the purpose of showing what happens when the numbers are different lengths when trying to center them. 

To run this code, use the printDataRJ file and use d8. It should print the table out with the headings centered, the heightIn cells  centered, and the dates right alligned. It should also have an age column that shows how old they are in years based on how long it's been since the birthday date passed.
